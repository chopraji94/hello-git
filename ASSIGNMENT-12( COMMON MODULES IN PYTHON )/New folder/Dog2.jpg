immutable - : once we create an object we are not allowed to change its content
In case __________  for that change a new object will be created 

why immutability?
*Reuseability
*Efficiency increases

shallow copy,deep copy

l = [1,2]
l1 = []
l1 = l
l1[0] = 44
print(l)

The original object contains any reference to mutable object then duplicate 

Tupple-:
It is imutable
denoted by()
we can include different type in tupple

we can declare tupple as t = 'Acadview',

Sets-:

s = set([1,2,3,4])
set is unordered collection of item
In this indexing and slicing is not possible
